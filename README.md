# Pauls-Video-Store
The final project for my Data Structures and Algorithms course CS 241 at Pace University.  We were tasked with a job that needed to be solved by implementing any data structure in Java we wanted as long as the tasks were done following the criteria needed to be met.

## **Description of Project will be provided via screenshot of assignment's criteria**
