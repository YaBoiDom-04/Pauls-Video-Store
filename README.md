# Pauls-Video-Store
The final project for my Data Structures and Algorithms course CS 241 at Pace University.  I was tasked with the same job my teacher once was faced with as his first paid code implementation of a redesign for a video store by implementing any data structure in Java as long as the tasks were done following the criteria needed to be met.

## **Description of Project will be provided via screenshot of assignment's criteria**
_Open to reworks and optimization of kinks in logic and codebase_

## **Final Project: Paul's Video Store**

## The codebase will be provided under the README files along with a nice description of each file to understand the workflow.

This was my chance to show off what I learned in class regarding data structures and how to get their full strength out when using them to prompt critical software-level changes in an outdated system.
5 Java classes were created to complete this project and the vision of how I wanted to meet every requirement, maybe not in a way that's efficient or best-use case, but in a way where I could understand how each object class aided in the full scope of the project.
I chose to implement ArrayList as the main data structure because of its fast insert and deletion capability for which a digital bookkeeping software used in a video store would be most applicable and the best way to keep track of the influx of customers a technological advancement like this to the service provided in the task to the consumer would lead to through basic economic inferencing about supply and demand.

# Here are some sample output screenshots along with some test cases for each of the requirements I completed successfully in the given time before the semester ended. Once again, since this is public, collaboration, insight, and general feedback is much appreciated.
Screenshots show software capability of adding users and movies, renting and returning movies, and finding users who've rented or not rented said movies. Touching up the 3 renting maximum feature along with the display of phone number and name when finding the user.
